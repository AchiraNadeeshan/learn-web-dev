# My Journey Through The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp Course

This repository documents my entire journey through **Dr. Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp**. It serves as a personal archive of all the projects, challenges, and notes I've completed while mastering the world of web development.

This course was a fantastic experience. Everything was explained clearly and concisely, making complex topics feel simple and accessible. It covered a huge range of tools and technologies, taking me from the very basics of HTML to building my own full-stack web applications. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone, even with zero prior programming experience, who wants to start a journey in web development.

## What I Learned

This course provided a comprehensive curriculum covering the full stack. Here are the key technologies and concepts I mastered:

### Front-End Web Development
- **HTML 5:** The structure and foundation of web pages.
- **CSS 3:** Styling and designing beautiful websites, including Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.
- **Bootstrap 4:** Building responsive, mobile-first layouts with a modern UI framework.
- **JavaScript ES6:** Programming logic, interactivity, and modern features of the language.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with and dynamically changing website content.
- **jQuery:** Simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling (still a valuable skill!).
- **React.js:** Building complex, stateful, and reusable UI components with a modern JavaScript library.
- **Web Design:** Principles of UI/UX and creating visually appealing user experiences.

### Back-End Web Development & Databases
- **Node.js:** Running JavaScript on the server to build fast and scalable applications.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Managing project dependencies and scripts.
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Creating dynamic HTML templates on the server.
- **RESTful APIs:** Designing and building APIs for client-server communication.
- **Databases:** Understanding and working with relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** A popular NoSQL database and an elegant object data modeling (ODM) library to interact with it.

### Tools & Deployment
- **Bash Command Line:** Navigating and managing files efficiently from the terminal.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential version control for tracking changes and collaborating on projects.
- **Deployment:** Bringing projects to life by deploying them on services like **GitHub Pages**, **Heroku**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

## Project Showcase

This repository contains over 15 projects, each one building on the last. Here are a few highlights that I'm particularly proud of.

***Note:*** *I will be adding screenshots for each project soon. The images below are placeholders.*

### 1. TinDog (Project 06)
A fun, responsive landing page for a fictional "Tinder for dogs" startup. This project was a deep-dive into the Bootstrap framework, focusing on responsive design, pricing tables, carousels, and testimonials.

### 2. The Simon Game (Project 11)
A digital recreation of the classic "Simon" memory game. This project was a fantastic challenge in JavaScript and jQuery, involving complex game logic, event handling, and playing sounds to create an interactive user experience.

### 3. To-Do List (Project 20)
A full-stack to-do list application built with Node.js, Express, and EJS. This was a major project that introduced me to back-end development, templating, and working with a MongoDB database to persist user data, including custom lists.

### 4. Keeper App (Project 24)
A clone of Google Keep built with React. This was my introduction to the world of modern front-end frameworks. I learned about components, props, state management, and how to build a dynamic and interactive single-page application (SPA).

### 5. Blog Website (Project 25)
A complete, database-driven blog website. This project tied everything together: EJS templating for the front-end, Node.js and Express for the back-end, and MongoDB for storing posts. Users can view all posts, read individual entries, and compose new ones.
